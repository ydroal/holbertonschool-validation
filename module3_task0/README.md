## Workflow
As part of the continuous integration process, this project uses GitHub Actions to automate the execution of certain tasks, such as running the make help command.

The workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/module3_task0.yml file. This workflow is triggered whenever changes are pushed to the main branch, and it is also scheduled to run at least once a day.

The workflow consists of one job that includes the following steps:

Checkout the repository code using the actions/checkout@v3 action.
Navigate to the directory containing the program code.
Run the make help command to verify that the Makefile exists and that it implements the help target.

## Build Workflow
The build workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/module3_task3.yml file. This workflow is triggered whenever changes are pushed to the main branch or a new tag is created. It automates the build process of the website, generates a zip file of the website when all the checks and tests are successful, and creates a new GitHub release with the zip file and the content of DEPLOY.md when the workflow is triggered by a new tag.

The build workflow includes the following steps:

- Checkout the repository code using the actions/checkout@v3 action.
- Install the necessary dependencies using the setup.sh script.
- Navigate to the directory containing the program code.
- Build the website using the make build command.
- Create a new blog post using the make post command.
- Clean up the dist/ directory using the make clean command.
- Package the website into a zip file using the make package command.
- Archive the zip file only if all the previous steps are successful using the actions/upload-artifact@v3 action.
- Create a new GitHub release with the zip file and the content of DEPLOY.md only if the workflow is triggered by a new tag using the softprops/action-gh-release@v1 action.
